# 🎬 What is NFLIX?
is a video streaming platform that showcases video content from various third-party sources within a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

# 🌟Features
Clean and straightforward design - focused solely on the content you want.
Responsive for both mobile and web.
Built with React, Vite, and SCSS for a modern and responsive user interface.

All content is sourced from third-party providers, with client-side scraping ensuring that no media files are stored on our servers. Videos are streamed directly from the original sources.

# 🚧 Limitations
As a static site, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is not supported.
To maintain low hosting costs, the number of proxied requests is limited.
For affordability, content is not streamed through the proxy, so only streams without CORS protection are supported.

# 🔧 Running Locally for Development
To get started locally, clone the repository. Then run the following commands in the root of the repository:

```
